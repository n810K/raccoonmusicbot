# raccoonmusicbot
![Python Versions][python-versions-badge]

This project is a music bot for discord. Its purpose is to play music while in a server, and acts as a replacement to the music bots that have since been shut down (Groovy, Rhythm).

## Features
- Play
- Pause
- Join
- Leave

This bot has extremely basic commands as it is not meant to be a full-fledged music bot. Rather, it is here to serve a simple purpose in playing quick small files.
